# olympics-map
An interactive map of Olympic medals, filterable by sport and country, since 1896

## Data Sources
Historic boundaries are sourced from [@aourednik on Github](https://github.com/aourednik/historical-basemaps/tree/master).

## TODO:
- Make dataset of Olympic participation so participating countries show as different color than non-participating countries
