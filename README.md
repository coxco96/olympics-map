# Olmypic Medals Map
An interactive map of Olympic medals, filterable by sport and country, since 1896

## URL
- [https://olympics-map.vercel.app](View and interact with the map here!)

## Data Sources
- Historic boundary maps are sourced from [@aourednik on Github](https://github.com/aourednik/historical-basemaps/tree/master).
- I created the dataset that powers this map by web scraping from Olympedia (1896-2022 games) and using data from the Olympic Games site (2024 games only).
- The underlying dataset is in a private Google Sheet, which the app connects to on initial load.
